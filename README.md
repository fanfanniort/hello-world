# hello-world

I'm a begginer in WEB development !

My name is Fran√ßois, I'm 35 and I live in Niort, France.

After 10 years worked as a barman, I wish to become a WEB-dev, which seems to be a very interesting job. To be honest, I'm more like a literature person, and mathematics aren't to easy for me, but still, I'm a persevering person, I tihnk.

I've been using Ubuntu with Xcfe (or similar like Linux Mint...) for about 10 years now. As far as I remember I always been crazy about computers, which is make sense for a purpose (a bit too late ?) in my life. 

So far, I followed some lessons in HTML and CSS (which were quite easy to me to understand) on the Internet. A couple of a days ago, I started with the JavaScript, but that makes me a bit confused, I have to work harder on this. 

Hopefully, I will have an entry at school from August 26th this year to April next year (I keep my fingers crossed for that, since I haven't passed tests and interview yet).

Feel free to write, and to give me some advices! Have a nice day guys and gals!
